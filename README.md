# SELF-CHECKUP
Weâ€™re proposing an efficient automated disease diagnosis model based on deep learning (neural networks) architecture. The Inerface of the application has been built using 
# Streamlit.

The prediction engine has been trained on Historical Claims Data and AHRQ Diseases and Symptoms.
The model preforms with ~ 91% accuracy on training data and with 81.2% accuracy on test dataset.

It helps to identify likelihood or probabilities of a disease from symptoms and existing diseases(if any). In addition to it, suggests specialists and recommend clinical tests associated with that Prognosis, which will eventually help the members to take timely actions and better self management of conditions.
